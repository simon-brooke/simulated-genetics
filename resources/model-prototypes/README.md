# README for model prototypes

These files are the most basic human male and female characters created with the [MakeHuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/) [MPFB]() plugin for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). At this stage, they're created by somone (me) who has absolutely no experience with Blender. They're here only to serve as proof of concept prototypes, to get the whole process bootstrapped.

The models are intended to be nude, and bald, so that hair and clothing can be applied later (although how this will work I don't yet understand), with eyes, eyebrows, eyelashes, teeth and tongue. The `.blend` files are the original files. The `.glb` files are exported by Blender. The `.j3o` files are created by reading the `.glb` files into [Maud](https://github.com/stephengold/Maud) and saving them. They are intended to have the standard MPFB 'rig helpers'.

At this stage, the (.glb) model when loaded into Maud, appears to be clothed, although there is nothing I have done to clothe it and the original `.blend` does not appear to be clothed in Blender. However, interestingly, when I import the `.glb` file back into blender I get only the rig, so I'm doing something wrong.

The model prototypes that should be here are

* female.blend
* female.glb
* female.j3o
* male.blend
* male.glb
* male.j3o

They're not included in the git repository at present because

1. They're large binary files;
2. They're really, really not very good;
3. You can do better yourself if you just do what I've described above.

Once I have all this working I will probably include model prototypes in the repository.
